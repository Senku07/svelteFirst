      <h1>How to Learn Code Fast</h1>
      <p> 
         Today, I'm talking with You how to learn code <b>FAST.</b>First of all I have a question in my <b>Mind</b>
      </p> 
         <h1>What is Code Or Programing?</h1> <br>
      <p>I know Everybody Know what is Code.You probably think Code means cool personailty, green line dancing in screen or some cool trick or main hack your friends account. <br>
      But what happen if I say everything you think means Your answer match to upper lines your wrong. Because Code in simple lines from my point of view <b>CODE is simply Some lines which help you to solve a problem. If You solve it without any Lines means You don't need code.</b> </p>

     <h1>If You Found a Problems?</h1> <br>
     <p>If you understand what I want to saying it's good because some people don't believe this line. Get to the point What happen if You found <b>Problem</b> First found out the main problem some time we a found a problem which not really exists. I know you not digest this line. I gave you example<br> When I'm starting my programer journey. I think about how I make cool stuff. I'm not know really anything. <br> You know my problem is not know anything my problem is <b>How I Start</b> If you gave attention this line You got the point. What I want to say.</p>

     <h1>After Founding Problem?</h1>
     <p>After You found your real problem. Just solve it using google or videos. It's look simple but not because you easily switch one page to another or one video to another this is called <b>"Tutotrial Hell"</b>. I know it's weird but this reallity When I started my journey I switch many videos and pages because I have no patience and If you were knew here you have also not because we want solution and then main problem come you rarely see what you want to see.
